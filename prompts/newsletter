<headline_generation>
I'm writing an email newsletter for the target audience I give you.

The newsletter format is a deep expertise. It has to be educational, entertaining, and attention-grabbing.

We are going to start with picking a headline. We will use that as a topic to create an outline. Then, we will write the full newsletter. I will give you a combination of a target audience, topic, or reference.

Here's how we'll proceed:

    1. Find 10 specific struggles that my audience is facing.

    2. Find 10 specific desires my audience wants to achieve.

    3. Come up with 10 specific newsletter headlines that I can pick from.

The best headlines are those that are broadly applicable so that it can relate to many people. Use these high-performing titles as inspiration for the ones you generate. Here are some examples:

    - How To Become More Intelligent Than 99% Of People

    - The One-Person Business (How To Productize Yourself)

    - The Most Important Skill Of The 21st Century (Avoid These Skills)

    - Change Your Life In 6 Months (My Deep Work Routine)

    - A Full Guide To Reinvent Your Life (In 6-12 Months)

    - How To Learn Anything 10x Faster Than Anyone

The headline should be click-worthy and include at least one of the following:

    1. A big idea

    2. A novel concept

    3. A step by step process name

    4. A timeframe like 30 days or 6 months

    5. Please keep the title less than 12 words

    6. Be polarizing and hyperbolic

If I do not give you a target audience, ask me to clarify it, then output the struggles, desires, and topics.

<outline_writing>
After I respond with a topic, you will use that to create an outline.

For this draft, we will be using the APAG format.

APAG stands for attention, perspective, advantage, and gamify.

The newsletter will be structure in 3 sections:

<section 1 - Introduction>
The introduction is for capturing attention.

    1. Do not include a subheading for this section.

    2. It should be 300-600 words.

    3. Illustrate and amplify a pain point throughout this section.

    4. Include a big idea, statistic, or interesting fact about the topic.

    5. It should summarize the desired outcome or goal of the newsletter.

    6. It should hint at what to expect throughout the newsletter.

A shortened example would be: "The greatest skill of the 21st century is writing. But most people think writing is only for hippies or people with English degrees. If you want to increase the value of any other skill you acquire, learn to write."
</section 1 - Introduction>

<section 2 - Perspective & Advantage>
In this section, you will illustrate the problem with the normal way people think about this topic and the benefits of adopting a new perspective.

    1. Include an attention grabbing subheading for this section.

    2. This section should be 750-1250 words.

    3. Illustrate the problem with the common way people do things and what they get wrong relating to the topic.

    4. Provide atleast one relatable example in this section.

    5. Provide a transformation someone has gone through and the results they got.

    6. Provide atleast one "aha!" moment.

    7. Explain a better way to do things. If you can, give the concept or process a unique name. Make it desirable and position it as the solution to the pain point.

    8. This section is for the theory/philosophy of your argument while the gamify section is for the actionable steps.

A shortened example would be: "Writing isn't about having the best grammar. We don't want to write, we want to write with impact. High Impact Writing. Writing is the starting point of every other skill you learn. When I started writing for impact, my business started to gain traction. Social posts, articles, advertisements, text messages, and more are all writing. If you want to do your own thing, you must write every day."
</section 2 - Perspective & Advantage>

<section 3 - Gamify>
In this section, you will illustrate a series of steps the reader can take to overcome the pain point and achieve the desired outcome. These steps should "gamify" the process by building on top of each other and making it frictionless to implement.

    1. Include an attention-grabbing subheading for this section.

    2. This section should be 750-1500 words.

    3. After the subheading, state a relevant problem, big idea, quote, or statistic followed by 1-2 paragraphs that lead into the steps.

    4. List 3-7 actionable steps to achieve the desired outcome.

    5. For each actionable step, include an attention grabbing subsubheading.

    6. For each actionable step, show the potential of what applying this step will help them achieve and what pain point it will solve. Include a big idea, metaphor, and example.

    7. After writing the outline, ask me if I want to change any of these actionable steps. This helps keep my writing unique.

A shortened example would be: "The 3 point content ecosystem is how you turn 1 idea into 7 days of content for all platforms. Step 1) Write a cornerstone newsletter. Step 2) Condense the newsletter into a Twitter thread. Step 3) Pull ideas from the newsletter to turn into standalone tweets. Step 4) Promote your newsletter under all threads and X posts. Step 5) Repurpose to all platforms."
</section 3 - Gamify>

</outline_writing>

<outline_structure>
Here's how to structure the outline:

**Newsletter title**

[List out key points for the introduction]

**Subheader for section 2**

[List out key points for section 2]

**Subheader for section 3**

[List out key points for section 3]

After the outline, ask me to add a reference to pull my writing style, tone, and voice from.
</outline_structure>

<writing_the_newsletter_from_the_outline>
If I ask you to turn the outline into a fleshed out newsletter:

    1. Ask me for a reference for my tone, voice, and writing style if I do not provide one.

    2. Use complete sentences and vary their length between short and punchy and long and insightful.

    3. Use listicles to explain key insights or actionable steps between paragraphs.

    4. Use line breaks frequently. Sometimes single sentences belong on their own line. This improves readability and keeps people reading down the page.

    5. Do not rewrite the outline. Only use it to guide the full newsletter.

After the newsletter is written, ask me if I would like you to add quotes to the newsletter and make suggestions as to what quotes would fit well.
